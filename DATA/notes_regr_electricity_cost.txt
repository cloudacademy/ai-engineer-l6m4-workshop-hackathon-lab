This dataset, titled "Powering Predictions: Unveiling the Dynamics of Electricity Costs in Modern Infrastructure," 
provides a realistic and comprehensive collection of 10,000 data points designed for electricity cost prediction. 
It encompasses a variety of factors influencing energy consumption and expenditure across different types of sites. 

The dataset includes the following key columns:

Site Area (square meters): Represents the physical size of the property, a primary driver of energy needs.

Structure Type: Categorizes the property into 'Residential', 'Commercial', 'Mixed-use', or 'Industrial', reflecting 
diverse operational and consumption patterns.

Water Consumption (liters/day): An indirect indicator of energy use, particularly for water heating and pumping.

Recycling Rate (%): Suggests the environmental consciousness and potential energy efficiency practices of the site.

Utilisation Rate (%): Indicates the operational intensity and capacity usage, directly impacting energy demand.

Air Quality Index (AQI): Can influence energy consumption through HVAC system usage for maintaining indoor air quality.

Issue Resolution Time (hours): A proxy for operational efficiency; longer resolution times may correlate with energy waste.

Resident Count (number of people): A significant factor for residential and mixed-use properties, directly affecting 
electricity usage.

Electricity Cost (USD/month): The target variable, representing the monthly electricity expenditure, influenced by all 
other parameters.

Each data point has been carefully generated to ensure realism and believability, with values falling within nominal 
and expected ranges for each respective column. The inter-column relationships have been modeled to reflect real-world 
scenarios, making this dataset suitable for developing and testing robust electricity cost prediction models.
